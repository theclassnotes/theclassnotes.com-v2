  It is a well-documented fact that three things get better with age: Wine, Cheese and A Cappella. The Class Notes, Cornell's Original Coed A Cappella Group, have been proving just that since they arrived on the hill in 1983. Known for their tight harmonies, varied reprtoire and spankalicious hotness, the Notes have a wide fan base and at least one stalker. The Class Notes have released a total of five albums, with a sixth on the way. Unfolded, their most recent CD, was well received by the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (<a href="http://www.rarb.org" target="_blank">RARB</a>), and one of the tracks has been selected to appear on Voices Only, an annual &quot;best of&quot; compilation disc. In addition to two annual concerts - Classified in the fall and Cuttin' Class in the spring - the Notes regularly appear at arch sings, on-campus gigs, and as a guest group for shows all over the East coast and beyond. (<a href="contactus.html">Click here for hiring and guest group requests.</a>) The Notes request that all fan mail, presents, and love child solicitations be sent to their campus mailbox by insured overnight post. </p>
